/* 
d. Write two separate C programs (one for server and other for client) using socket APIs for UDP, in which the client will accept strings from the user and send it to the server along with the substring to be searched. The server will check whether the substring is present or not and accordingly it should send a proper message to the client. Client will display the received message sent by the server. Client should continue to send the messages until the user enters the string’stop’.
